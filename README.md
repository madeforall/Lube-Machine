This is a public madeforall project Madeforall is a local nonprofit dedicated to distributing keyboard kits to those who lack the necessary tools for digital literacy. We collect tech donations from community members both in local and global communities. These donations are then refurbished, cleaned and given to our nonprofit partners in our local communities to distribute these donations to the people who need it the most.

This project is free and public to use to anyone interested, it was created to provide keyboard enthusiasts more options on custom keyboards. We have created this in hopes of bring more people into the hobby. Learn more about us at madeforall.org, donate to us here: https://hcb.hackclub.com/donations/start/madeforall
